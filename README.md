# Baby Neural Nets

Run `python convert_images.py` to read any PNGs stored in [source_images/](source_images/). Make sure to set the number of color channels in the source code. This will build a file named `image_data.h5`.

Run the main program with the base name of the file to start generating images. Ex.

    python MLP_model.py pepsi
    python MLP_model.py apple
    python MLP_model.py london_underground

The parameters to the MLP are stored within the main file. Or better yet, watch the presentations!
